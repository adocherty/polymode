Polymode
========

The Polymode Modal Solver is a project is a library for the calculation
of mode patterns and parameters in optical fibers, especially microstructured 
optical fiber (MOF) or photonic crystal fibers (PCF) with silica or polymer 
construction.

The focus of Polymode is to find large numbers of leaky modes automatically in
microstructured optical fibers of arbitrary cross section using novel mode
calculation algorithms.

This project intends to create a library to find modes of optical fibers with 
arbitrary cross-section robustly. The code is based on Python and Numpy/Scipy,
with extentions in C++. Matplotlib is required for the plotting functionality.
