#summary Introducing Polymode and how to create and solve for modes in basic structures.

=Introduction to Polymode=

Polymode is object oriented, open source and is written in Python with extentions in C++.
It aims to allow the specification of a fiber geometry with the minimum of commands in the most intuitive and flexible was. The main objects that the user sees are:
 * Waveguide: The MOF structure is created as a Waveguide object
     containing
 * Material: Each material contains the dispersion profile of the
     material over a specified wavelength range. Polymode contains an internal
     database of materials and can import definitions from different formats.
 * Mode: Modes calculated are stored with the field information and
     effective index allowing easy manipulation and storage.
 * Solver: Different numerical solvers can be used for each problem to
     find the modes of the structure

In the following sections we take a quick tour of each of the modules of Polymode.

==Materials==

Polymode contains an inbuilt set of commonly used materials.

{{{
air = Material.Air()
m1 = Material.Silica()
m2 = Material.PMMA()
}}}

More materials can be loaded from [http://swiss.csail.mit.edu/~jaffer/FreeSnell/ Freesnell] [http://www.luxpop.com/ Luxpop] or [http://www.sopra-sa.com/ Sopra] formatted files. It also contains data from the freely available Freesnell and Sopra materials.

Material objects contain all information about the refractive index of the material, and can be queried and plotted.

==Waveguide Structure==
Once the materials have been defined, we can use them to form an arbitrary structure.
We can place different shapes including circules, elipses, spline curves and polygons.

The waveguide is created defining a subtrate material (which also extends past the computational boundary) and a symmetry.
{{{
wg = Waveguide.Waveguide(material=m2, symmetry=6)
}}}
	
For example to create a six hole waveguide we place a single hole, as we have specified the rotational symmetry of the waveguide to be 6 the hole implicitly occurs 6 times. 
{{{
s = Waveguide.Circle(air, center=(6.75,0), radius=2.0)
wg.add_shape(s)
}}}

We can see this plotting the waveguide:
{{{
wg.plot()
}}}
