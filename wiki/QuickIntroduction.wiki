#summary Introducing Polymode and how to create and solve for modes in basic structures.

=Introduction to Polymode=

==Materials==

Polymode contains an inbuilt set of commonly used materials.

{{{
air = Material.Air()
m1 = Material.Silica()
m2 = Material.PMMA()
}}}

More materials can be loaded from [http://swiss.csail.mit.edu/~jaffer/FreeSnell/ Freesnell] [http://www.luxpop.com/ Luxpop] or [http://www.sopra-sa.com/ Sopra] formatted files. It also contains data from the freely available Freesnell and Sopra materials.

Material objects contain all information about the refractive index of the material, and can be queried and plotted.

==Waveguide Structure==
Once the materials have been defined, we can use them to form an arbitrary structure.
We can place different shapes including circules, elipses, spline curves and polygons.

The waveguide is created defining a subtrate material (which also extends past the computational boundary) and a symmetry.
{{{
wg = Waveguide.Waveguide(material=m2, symmetry=6)
}}}
	
For example to create a six hole waveguide we place a single hole, as we have specified the rotational symmetry of the waveguide to be 6 the hole implicitly occurs 6 times. 
{{{
s = Waveguide.Circle(air, center=(6.75,0), radius=2.0)
wg.add_shape(s)
}}}

We can see this plotting the waveguide:
{{{
wg.plot()
}}}
