Todo:


mathlink.coordinates:
* Unequal node spacings
* Coordinate for triangulation
* Different interpolation algorithms

* Move fourier interpolation out of class


Waveguide:
* Deprecate special wgcoord


Modes:


LayeredSolver:
* LayeredMode needs several changes to work with all Mode functions
  In particular it needs a default coord discretization size so functions
  which require numerical evaluation will work

* LayeredMode can also perform many functions analytically - eg mode power
